Growing up, my sisters and I heard voices, saw lights and dreamed of other beings. My mother and I shared a recurring dream of strangers on the driveway, where stonewalls marked the old main road through town. Our dreams and our memories converged into one experience, the experience of living in a haunted house. After the sale of the property in 2001, my recurring dreams returned and the question emerged - were we the ones now haunting the house? When I ask my father about the past, he answers with the Theory of Relativity, the Laws of Thermodynamics, and the speed of light. He dreams of being on a distant star, with a telescope powerful enough to show him how things used to be. Just as we perceive the moon, as it was 1.2 seconds ago and the sun, as it existed 8 minutes ago, great distances allow us an opportunity to look back in time.",

Bessie is overjoyed when she learns from father that three noblemen are to honor them with their presence. Father incidentally suggests that if the noblemen do not come up to her expectations to patch up her little quarrel with Billy and say no more about marrying a title.
